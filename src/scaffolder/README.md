# Scaffolder

_This is NOT actually the Scaffolder framework; this is just adapted from Scaffolder._

Stuff in this subdirectory is just more general-purpose logic taken from Scaffolder that shouldn't relate strongly to game-specific logic.

There's value in keeping this stored in a separate place from the rest of the more game-specific stuff.
